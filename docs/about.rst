About blenderseed
+++++++++++++++++

The orginal appleseed integration into blender was written by François Beaune when appleseed was in an alpha state. It was a primitive plugin, matching an equally primitive (at the time) renderer.  Over the next several years appleseed grew and improved in leaps and bounds, and blenderseed has grown along with it thanks to the dedication and efforts of many volunteer authors:
