- Material Slot:
    This window is where you create and name materials.
- Preview:
    You can see a preview of the material here.
- Preview Quality:
    This allows a user to set the sample count of the preview window.  Higher numbers will have longer render times.
- Lighting Samples:
    Raising this number may resolve render noise by raising the number of direct lighting samples.
