- Spike Threshold:
    How bright a pixel has to be compared to its neighbors to be considered a spike
- Patch Distance:
    This controls the overall level of denoising that will be applied.  Raising this too high can lead to a blurry image
- Denoise Scales:
    This sets how many scale levels are used to remove low frequency noise from the image
- Random Pixel Order:
    TODO
- Skip Denoised Pixels:
    TODO
- Prefilter Spikes:
    This option tries to filter out overly bright pixels (firflies) before denoising
- Mark Invalid Pixels:
    TODO
