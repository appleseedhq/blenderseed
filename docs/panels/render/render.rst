- Export appleseed Files Only
	- This options tells blenderseed to create the scene files for rendering and export the geometry only.  The rendering process will not be triggered.  This allows you to render the scene at a later time using the appleseed command line or appleseed.studio.
- Render
	- This button triggers the exporting process, and then the actual render if the export only button is not selected.
- Animation
	- Render a sequential output of frames (determined by the start and end frame settings).
- Display
	- This determines how the Blender desktop will change to accomodate the rendered image.
